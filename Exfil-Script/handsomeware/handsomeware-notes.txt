“We may be charming, but your data’s not safe with us!”

Good evening, beautiful user. We regret (not really) to inform you that your files are now lounging on a virtual beach, sipping binary piña coladas—locked up and loving it.

But fear not! This isn't your average malicious malware. Handsomeware is classy, respectful, and devastatingly good-looking. All it wants is a little attention... and maybe a few cat memes in exchange for your data’s safe return.

To unlock your files:
- Send a compliment to yourself. You deserve it.
- Pledge to never reuse the same password again. Seriously.
- Share this delightful experience with a friend (educational purposes only, of course).

Remember: Handsomeware isn’t here to hurt—just to flirt... with your awareness of cybersecurity risks. 😏

Stay safe, stay suave,
—XYPERIA
